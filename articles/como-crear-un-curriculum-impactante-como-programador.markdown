- resumes are more about advertising than anything else
- el primer consejo que te da es que no escribas tu propio currículum, 
si no que lo haga un profesional, proporcinándole tú los datos, claro
- The point of hiring someone to write your resume is not to do the 
grunt work of compiling data; it’s to present that data in a short, 
succinct, and compelling format that makes you look as appealing as 
possible.
- produce a few different versions of your resume and cover letter
- personaliza muchísimo cada CV que entregues
- What Makes a Good Resume?
- lo primero de todo, que se vea bien, es puro márketing
- a resume needs to communicate, quickly and effectively, what you 
are all about and what value you can bring to a prospective employer
- a nadie le importa lo que tú quieres, les interesa más qué valor
les vas a aportar
- Your resume, then, should be short and to the point, as specialized 
as possible, and highlight the most important Herculean achievements 
you’ve amassed over the course of your career
- Ultimately, you want to portray very clearly **what your skills and 
expertise are**, **how you’ve used them** in the past to achieve great 
results, and how those skills might be transferred to the future 
position you are applying for
- Everything you write in your resume should be thought about from 
the perspective of the value you provide, not what you want
- customize the resume to show the unique value you can apply to the 
specific job you are applying for
- Use this format: What you did, How you did it, The results you got
- A resume, just like a good advertisement, should be as short as
possible to get the sale, have your resume fit on a single page
- You are going to want to have more than one base version of your 
resume that you can use for different kinds of jobs you might apply 
for
- make it unique: The idea of a resume is to stand out
-
