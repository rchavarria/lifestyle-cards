Some recomendations for senior devs when pairing with junior devs

## 1. Don't type

Instead, tells the junior what to type, or even better, ask them questions that
help them figure out what to do next.The only way they're going to learn is by
doing it themselves.

## 2. Let them make mistakes

You want to develop their judgement even more than you wnat to develp their
knowledge. So, don't tell them exactly what to do.

If they want to try something you know will be a dead end, just say, "let's try
it, and see what happens".

## 3. Take breaks

It's exhausting. The experience gap means a lot of extra explaining. It's ok to
take breaks.

## 4. Be prepared to say "I don't know"

They'll ask questions about why things are done a certain way that you'll not have
thought about for years.

Just say, "I don't know, let's figure it out" and show your pair how you figure
out something you don't know.

## 5. Find what they can teach you

Your junior pair knows less than you about programming, but you need to give them
a chance to invert that relationship so that you feel more like social equals.

Ask them about their weekend, every single person is an expert on something. Once
you know it, ask them thoughtful questions about it. Make it clear you don't know
too much about it but you want to learn. 

> This reminds me about "sincere curiosity" or something like that. See notes on
books "How to make friends",...

**Bringing junior devs to the team increases the quality**: it forces you to make
*explicit* a lot of knowledge that was previously *implicit* between more
experienced devs

**Juniors bring in a fresh perspective**
