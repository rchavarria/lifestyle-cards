- effectiveness vs. efficiency
- Do / Drop / Delegate / Defer it
- people will tell you what happened in the world
- pay full attention to what you're currently doing
- Anything longer (3-4 sentences) should be on a blog or wiki or on your product's documentation, FAQ or knowledge base
- Triage the inbox of your life

# Looooong version

[Scale yourself, by Scott Hanselman](https://zapier.com/blog/scale-yourself-scott-hanselman/)

# Search for danger signs

- "I just need to work late to catch up"
- Hope is not a plan, Hope is nothing but waiting and letting life happen to you

# Effectiveness Vs. Efficiency

	Effectiveness is doing the right things.
	Efficiency is doing things right.

# Drop the ball

- Do It
- Drop it
- Delegate it
- Defer it

# Resolve inbox issues

- Don't check email in the morning
- Find your Robert Scoble (people will tell you what happened in the world)
- Remain in your flow : 
	- "anything important that happens in the world, will come your (way) many times"
	- trabaja en lo que sea, pero con toda tu atencion en ello
- Conserve your keystrokes
	- Keep your emails to 3-4 sentences, Hanselman says. Anything longer should be on a blog or wiki or on your product's documentation, FAQ or knowledge base
- Triage the inbox of your life
- Get Rid of Psychic Weight
	- Whatever is "pending" in your life, drop it, Hanselman [suggests on his blog](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/PsychicWeightLifeIsPending.aspx)
- Reserve Fridays for Reflection
	- [Rule of 3](http://sourcesofinsight.com/the-rule-of-3/) Write down 3 things you'll do today, ... this week, ... this year. And do them!!
	- you need to have a vision on Monday of what your week looks like, and on Friday you need to stop and look back on your week and think about the reflection
- Realize that Being Busy is a form of Laziness
