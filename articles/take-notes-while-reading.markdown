# [A process of taking notes while reading](http://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2013/11/taking-notes-while-reading/)

- When I start reading the book, I have an idea about what it’s about
- While reading I **take** notes. I **circle** words I need to look up. I **star** important points that I think are critical to the argument. I **underline** anything that strikes me as interesting. I **comment** like a mad man in the margins
- At the end of each chapter I write a few bullet points that summarize what I’ve just read
- After some time (1 to N weeks) I pick the book up again, I re-read every scribble, underline, and comment I’ve made (assuming I can still read my writing).
- If something still strikes my interest, I write a summary with my own words (it’s ways to apply the knowledge)
- I’ll create a sort of mental summary of the book’s main arguments and gaps that I think exist
